Please download the latest version of the MySQL connector for Java here:

    http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/

and rename it to mysql-connector.jar for build/test.
    
This connector is GPL, and not license compatible with One-JAR: it should not be embedded inside
a One-JAR distribution without full consideration of this fact.
