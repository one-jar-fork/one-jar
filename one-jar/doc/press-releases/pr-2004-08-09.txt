Pacific Grove, CA (PRWEB) August 11, 2004 -- SimonTuffs.com announces Version 0.95 
of One-JAR. One-JAR streamlines the packaging of Java applications that depend on 
multiple resources (such as other JAR files) into a single file which can be 
executed directly using the "java -jar" launcher. One-JAR helps eliminate the need 
for complex operating-system dependent installers and launch scripts, while 
preserving the boundaries of constituent components within the final distribution. 

One-JAR simplifies configuration control and version management, and helps avoid 
license issues surrounding the redistribution of third party JAR files in an 
unmodified form. One-JAR uses a powerful custom classloader to avoid pollution 
of the file-system with expanded directory trees, keeping the runtime disk 
footprint compact and efficient. One-JAR also can be used to record and reconstruct 
the minimal class set needed to support an application, with up to 70% reduction 
in binary image size.

One-JAR is released under a liberal BSD-styl.e Open Source license on 
SourceForge.net at: http://one-jar.sourceforge.net. Version 1.0 of One-JAR is 
anticipated for Q4 2004.
