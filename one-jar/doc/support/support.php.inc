<h2>Professional Support</h2>
One-JAR is Open-Source: it is licensed without guarantee or support but with full access to the source code.
If this proves insufficient, you can obtain professional consulting services on a contract basis by 
sending an email request to <i>one-jar-support(@)simontuffs.com</i> (remove the parentheses -- there is no spam-blocker
on this address for now, and I hope to leave it that way).</a>

consulting methods including Skype, Email, Instant Messaging and Remote Desktop debugging sessions
