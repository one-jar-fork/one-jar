		<h1>Deliver Your Java Application in One-JAR!</h1>
		<b>by P. Simon Tuffs, Software Architect and Consultant (<a href="http://www.simontuffs.com">www.simontuffs.com</a>)</b>
		<p>
		<hr>
		<p>
		<h2>Introduction (or <a href="#quickstart">Quickstart</a>)</h2>
		Delivering a runnable Java application is an exercise often frought with complexity and frustation.
		In principle, if you have a main class called <code>com.mydomain.mypackage.Main</code>, you can simply say:
		<ul><pre>
java com.mydomain.mypackage.Main	</pre></ul>
		However, this assumes that some magic has been applied to your shell environment
		to set the value of your <code>CLASSPATH</code> so that the java runtime can actually find this class.
		The <code>CLASSPATH</code> also has to contain all of the other classes which will be loaded and executed
		by your main program.  
		<p>This is where things start to get much more complicated.  Multiple entries on the <code>CLASSPATH</code> must
		be separated by a special character, and this special character is unfortunately operating system
		dependent (since it would otherwise interact badly with the common command shells).  For example
		on UNIX it is ':', on DOS it is ';'.  If these choices were reversed, the command shell on each
		operating system would become very confused.  And there had better not be version any conflicts between
		entries on the <code>CLASSPATH</code>: the order of entries 
		controls the order of class resolution, incompatible versions created by incorrect orderings 
		will lead to obscure <code>NoSuchMethodException</code> exceptions and other runtime problems.
		<p>Wouldn't it be nice if you could just wrap up all your classes into one big executable, 
		and run it?  Well the Java2 Runtime Environment has a way of doing this using a JAR launcher.
		If you bundle your class, and all the supporting classes in a file called myapp.jar, and
		set the <code>MANIFEST.MF</code> appropriately, you can simply say:
		
		<ul><pre>
java -jar myapp.jar </pre></ul>
		Very nice.  So what's the catch?  There are numerous.  One catch is that you must first unjar all of the supporting
		classes and flatten them out into a single directory tree before creating the final 
		myapp.jar.  For example: what happens if your application depends on some of the
		web-services JAR files from the Java Web Services Developer Pack?  There are many of them
		and they all contain code which lives in the same packages (javax.*, com.sun.* etc).
		<p>Is this a problem?  Well it may be.  Consider that after you have expanded all of the
		code into a single tree, you have lost all trace of any code signatures that might have been
		present.  Why?  Because code signatures are located in <code>/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF</code> file, and 
		each jar file will contain one of these manifest files, with different content.  Likewise,
		any resources which have the same name (a distinct possibility given that the jar files
		themselves may contain flattened out packages) will be in conflict: you can only have one
		file called <code>log4j.properties</code> to control logging, where you might like to enable/disable
		logging on a boundary set by the individual jar files.
		<p>Wouldn't it be nice if you could just bundle the supporting jar-files into your <code>myapp.jar</code>
		file without expanding them?  This is the problem addressed, and solved, by One-JAR.
		
		<h2>Class-Path Manifest Does Not Work (like you might think!)</h2>
		Judging by the conversations on Usenet which we have seen, many people have tried and
		failed to use the <code>META-INF/MANIFEST.MF</code> property called <code>Class-Path</code> to 
		solve this problem. 
		<p>But first, lets set up a concrete example of what we're trying to do.  Suppose our
		main class, plus other classes we have written is in a JAR file called <code>main.jar</code>
		Suppose that our application depends on two other JAR files, called <code>a.jar, b.jar</code>
		Can we construct a manifest which will allow the JAR launcher to run this?  First, we construct
		our compound Jar file:
		
		<ul><pre> 
$ jar -tf myapp.jar
META-INF/MANIFEST.MF
lib/a.jar
lib/b.jar
main/main.jar </pre></ul>
			The manifest contains a <code>Main-Class</code> setting to launch our application, 
			and entries for the supporting JAR files <code>a.jar</code> and <code>b.jar</code>.
		<ul><pre>
Manifest-Version: 1.0
Class-Path: main/main.jar lib/a.jar lib/b.jar
Main-Class: com.main.Main </pre></ul>
		What happens if you run this?
		<ul><pre>
$ java -jar myapp.jar
A()
B() </pre></ul>
		Looks good, exactly what we want right?  Wrong.  What's happening here is that the
		<code>Class-Path</code> entries are being resolved in the file-system, not inside
		the JAR file.  If you move this JAR file somewhere else and try to run it, you get the following:
		<ul><pre>
$ java -jar myapp.jar
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: com/main/Main </pre></ul>
		This is most unfortunate, and most frustrating, and pretty much unexpected by 
		developers who follow this route.
		<p>What about using the 'jar:' protocol in the <code>Class-Path</code> entry?  This
		doesn't work either.  It appears that the JAR loader only supports file-based URLS. Which is where One-JAR 
		comes in.
		<h2>One-JAR: Cracking the Problem</h2>
		At this stage we have laid out a rational format for our application JAR file.  This layout is 
		in the spirit of the layout specified by J2EE containers for Web-Application and Enterprise Application
		code, and there is a reason for this as we will see.
		<ul>
			<li>The main class jar-file is placed in a sub-directory named <code>main</code></li>
			<li>The supporting code jar-files are placed in a sub-directory named <code>lib</code></li>
		</ul>
		<a name="quickstart"/>
		<h2>QuickStart</h2>
		All that is required to enable an application for launching with One-JAR is to create a bootstrap
		environment which is capable of installing a classloader that understands the One-JAR layout, and 
		which can locate and start the main program.  
		<p>If you're really impatient to see One-JAR
		in action without writing any code or jarring any jars, <a href="#impatient">follow this link</a>.
		
		<p>At this point we have to augment our <code>myapp.jar</code> file with some bootstrap
		code, and a <code>META-INF/MANIFEST.MF</code> file to let the bootstrap code assume
		control.  
		<p>One-JAR ships with a pre-built bootstrap jar file called <code>one-jar-boot.jar</code> that contains all the code you need
		to do this.  You can download the latest pre-built 
		one-jar-boot.jar here: <a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/one-jar/one-jar-boot-0.95.jar?download">
			<img align="middle" border="0" src="one-jar.jpg"/></a>
		<ul><pre>
$ jar -tf one-jar-boot.jar
META-INF/MANIFEST.MF
com/simontuffs/onejar/Boot.class
com/simontuffs/onejar/Handler$1.class
com/simontuffs/onejar/Handler.class
com/simontuffs/onejar/JarClassLoader$ByteCode.class
com/simontuffs/onejar/JarClassLoader.class
boot-manifest.mf </pre></ul>
		There are five classes which control the bootstrap process, all residing in the <code>com.simontuffs.onejar</code>
		package.  We'll be discovering the details of these later.
		<p>There is also a pre-built manifest file called <code>boot-manifest.mf</code>.  To complete
		the One-JAR deployment process, create a suitable directory and expand this file into it, then
		update the <code>myapp.jar</code> file as follows:
		<ul><pre>
$ mkdir boot
$ cd boot
$ jar -xvf ../one-jar-boot.jar
$ jar -uvfm ../myapp.jar boot-manifest.mf . </pre></ul>
		Thats it!  You can now run your application in the simplest possible fashion:
		<ul><pre>
$ java -jar myapp.jar
A()
B() </pre></ul>
		<h2>But How Do I Know It's Working?</h2>
		This looks like the previous <i>working</i> case, how do you know that things are
		actually going to work when you move this JAR file to a new location and run it?
		<p>Well, One-JAR has some built-in diagnostics that you can enable to see what it is 
		doing on behalf of your application.  These can be enabled using command-line switches
		to the JVM, placed before the <code>-jar</code> option:
		<ul>
			<li><code>-Done-jar.info</code>: Enable <code>INFO</code> level diagnostics.  These
			show high-level operations inside the One-JAR support code.</li>
			<li><code>-Done-jar.verbose</code>: Enable <code>VERBOSE</code> level diagnostics.  These
			show in tedious detail the operations inside One-JAR, including class-loading and 
			resource resolution. </li>
		</ul>
		Let's look at the program output when we enable each of these diagnostic levels:
		<ul><pre>
$ java -Done-jar.info -jar myapp.jar
Boot: Info: using JarClassLoader
JarClassLoader: Info: caching lib/a.jar
JarClassLoader: Info: caching lib/b.jar
JarClassLoader: Info: caching main/main.jar
A()
B() </pre></ul>
		Now we see that something interesting is indeed happening inside the application: One-JAR is 
		using a custom classloader called <code>JarClassLoader</code> to load information 
		from the <code>myapp.jar</code> file.  We can get more detail:
		<ul><pre>
$ java -Done-jar.verbose -jar myapp.jar
Boot: Info: using JarClassLoader
JarClassLoader: Info: caching lib/a.jar
JarClassLoader: Cached bytes for class com.a.A.class
JarClassLoader: Info: caching lib/b.jar
JarClassLoader: Cached bytes for class com.b.B.class
JarClassLoader: Info: caching main/main.jar
JarClassLoader: Cached bytes for class com.main.Main.class
JarClassLoader: findClass(com.main.Main)
JarClassLoader: found com.main.Main in main/main.jar
JarClassLoader: findClass(com.a.A)
JarClassLoader: found com.a.A in lib/a.jar
A()
JarClassLoader: findClass(com.b.B)
JarClassLoader: found com.b.B in lib/b.jar
B() </pre></ul>
		Notice how the <code>JarClassLoader</code> keeps track of where classes came
		from: for example the <code>com.a.A</code> class is contained inside the <code>lib/a.jar</code>
		file inside <code>myapp.jar</code>.
		<p>At this stage you should be asking "How does One-JAR decide which is the main class?".
		The <i>conventional</i> way would be to have a manifest attribute in the top-level JAR
		file <code>myapp.jar</code> and require this to be edited before the final jar was
		assembled.  But this is all unnecessary: One-JAR simply looks for a jar file inside the <code>main</code>
		sub-directory of the composite JAR file <code>myapp.jar</code>, and provided that that JAR file has a <code>Main-Class</code> manifest
		attribute, it will be used as the main entry point.  This allows an existing main-class JAR file to be bundled inside
		a One-JAR archive without further modification!
			
		<p>That's a high-level overview of One-JAR, next we'll get into the details behind the
		custom classloader <code>JarClassLoader</code> and what it does to make all of this
		possible.

		<a name="#impatient"/><h2>Super-Quick Start One-JAR Example</h2>
		<p>If you're really in a hurry to see One-JAR in action, there is a pre-built One-JAR example which
		can be downloaded here: <a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/one-jar/one-jar-example-0.95.jar?download">
			<img align="middle" border="0" src="one-jar.jpg"/></a>
		<p>Once you save this file to disk you can
		run it as shown below.  Note that this example is fairly complex (it's really a regression test for
		the One-JAR product and should be broken out into JUnit tests).  We'll be discussing 
		precisely what is going on in the next section.  
		<p>You can gain more insight into the role of the One-JAR
		classloader by running with a <code>java -Done-jar.verbose</code> command.  Don't be perturbed by the failure, it is expected
		and caused by pathalogical behaviour in one of the test cases.
